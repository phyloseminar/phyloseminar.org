Genome sequences from infectious pathogens can help us discriminate case introductions from local transmission, crucial information for targeting public health interventions. In this talk, I’ll discuss our efforts to generate and analyze SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from Switzerland, with a focus on evaluating several major public health interventions. 

We sequenced 11,357 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Switzerland in 2020 - the 6th largest effort globally. Using a representative subset of these data, we first estimated viral introductions to Switzerland and their persistence based on phylogenetic reconstructions. We compare these estimates to simplistic models in the absence of several public health interventions. Compared to the expectation that case introductions are coupled with incidence in neighboring countries, we observe a 94% reduction corresponding to Switzerland’s spring 2020 border closures. Then, compared to the expectation that local persistence of new introductions is constant through time, we observe a rough halving in persistence corresponding to Switzerland’s spring 2020 lockdown. Finally, we quantified local transmission dynamics using a birth-death phylodynamic model conditioned on the identified introductions, with a novel extension to test for a contact tracing effect. Under this model, we estimate transmission slowed 35 – 63% upon outbreak detection in summer 2020, but not in fall. This finding may indicate successful contact tracing over summer before overburdening in fall. 

Altogether, I will highlight some of the successes and remaining challenges in our efforts to generate epidemiologically useful information from SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences.
