Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is on the fossilized birth-death process, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Joëlle Barido-Sottani.
Joelle did her PhD at the ETH Zürich under Tanja Stadler, then a 2-year postdoc with Tracy Heath at Iowa State, and will soon be a Marie-Curie fellow working with Hélène Morlon at the ENS in Paris.
Her main research interests are the development and use of birth-death models for Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference.
She is also interested in exploring better programming practices for inference software frameworks, to make them more reliable and maintainable.

Welcome, Joelle, and thank you for participating!
