The fossilized birth-death (FBD) process provides an integrated model for phylogenetic inference by combining the data from fossil samples with extant species into a unified evolutionary process. It has been used for many empirical studies, including total-evidence analyses which use morphological character data in addition to molecular sequences to infer the position of fossils in the phylogeny. However, many questions remain about how to best conduct FBD analyses in practice. User choices on how to model features of the fossil record such as fossil age uncertainty, trait-driven variations in fossil sampling rates, and many others, can have strong and unexpected impacts on inference accuracy. In this talk, I will present my current work exploring the behavior of the FBD process in realistic analyses, demonstrating both the possibilities and the practical challenges associated with integrating fossils into FBD phylogenetic analyses.
