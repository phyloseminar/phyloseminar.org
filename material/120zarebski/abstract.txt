The COVID-19 pandemic has seen large numbers of viral genomes sequenced and
thrust genetic epidemiology into the public eye: the reproduction number and the
prevalence of infection are of particular interest. While the amount of
sequencing done is unprecedented, most cases still only appear as part of time
series, and consequently may be left out of phylodynamic inference. Variations
of the fossilised birth-death model present a way to estimate both the
reproduction number and prevalence of infection using both sequences and
occurrence data. Unfortunately, the calculations involved are computationally
challenging. The TimTam package for BEAST2 implements an approximation scheme
that extends previous work to utilise time series of cases and makes the
computation feasible. I will give an overview of the approximation scheme (and
potential extensions to incorporate additional data) and demonstrate how to use
the TimTam package.
