Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is evolutionary ecology, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Chris Wheat, an Associate Professor at Stockholm University. Chris did his PhD at Stanford University. The road from California to Stockholm took him through 2 postdocs, the first in Germany at the Max Planck for Chemical Ecology and the second split between the University of Helsinki and Penn State University. Chris’ work uses an ecological and evolutionary functional genomics approach to study plant-insect interactions, life history tradeoffs, and seasonal plasticity. He no longer wears a ponytail, but that’s how I remember him best.

Welcome, Chris, and thank you for participating!
