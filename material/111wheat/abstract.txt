Genomic scale datasets are becoming the norm in phylogenetic studies, greatly increasing our ability to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and patterns of trait evolution. Beyond providing an increased phylogenetic certainty, the study of traits on trees is entering a new era with genomic data, as comparative genomics also provides a means of gaining insights into the basis of traits. After highlighting recent advances in this area, I will focus upon the evolution of color change in Pieridae butterflies, highlighting variation in Coliadinae (a subfamily of ~300 species). While phylogenetic reconstruction methods suggest that orange and white color variation is an ancient polymorphism within this subfamily, whether this is due to a shared mechanism is difficult to test. Here, using a range of genomic approaches (comparative genomics, genome wide association studies), I use phylogenetic principals to integrate this data, formulate hypotheses and then test them using gene manipulation. During this talk I will work hard to highlight some of the challenges involved, which arise from rapid radiations and causal alleles that segregate as insertion/deletion variation.
