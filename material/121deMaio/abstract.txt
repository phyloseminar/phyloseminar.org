The Covid pandemic has found us surprisingly unprepared: we needed, and often still need, computational tools (including phylogenetic methods) to investigate datasets of millions of viral genomes for many applications. It is expected that these datasets will only grow larger, probably outgrowing our computational power. In this talk I will discuss some methodological advancements we and others developed to more efficiently estimate phylogenetic trees from pandemic genome data, and I will in particular focus on MAPLE, a new approach for efficient likelihood-based phylogenetics of closely related genomes. I will however also describe other problems/methods, such as simulation of genome evolution, the issue of errors in sequence data, the identification of mutational and selective forces acting on genome evolution.
