Dana did her PhD with Prof. Itay Mayrose and Prof. Tal Pupko at Tel-Aviv University. Broadly speaking, Dana is interested in modelling the genome evolution using AI-based approaches (as well as exploring music and sea sports). Dana is currently finding her new way as a data scientist

Welcome, Dana, and thank you for participating!
