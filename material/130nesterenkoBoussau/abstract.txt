An important problem in molecular evolution is that of phylogenetic reconstruction, that is, given a
set of sequences descending from a common ancestor, the reconstruction of the binary tree describing
their evolution from the latter. State-of-the-art methods for the task, namely Maximum likelihood and
Bayesian inference, have a high computational cost, which limits their usability on large datasets.
Recently researchers have begun investigating deep learning approaches to the problem but so far these
attempts have been limited to the reconstruction of quartet tree topologies, addressing phylogenetic
reconstruction as a classification problem. We present here a radically different approach with
a transformer-based network architecture that, given a multiple sequence alignment, predicts all
the pairwise evolutionary distances between the sequences, which in turn allow us to accurately
reconstruct the tree topology with standard distance-based algorithms. The architecture and its high
degree of parameter sharing allow us to apply the same network to alignments of arbitrary size, both
in the number of sequences and in their length. We evaluate our network Phyloformer on two types
of simulations and find that its accuracy matches that of a Maximum Likelihood method on datasets
that resemble training data, while being significantly faster.
