Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is state-dependent speciation and extinction models, and this the third talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Jos Kafer.

Jos has always been interested in plant diversity, but he also has enjoyed, and still enjoys, studying the fields of theoretical biology, genomics, bioinformatics and biophysics. In particular, his recent research interests have been the genomics of plant sex chromosomes, as well as the evolution of reproductive systems and their consequences. Jos is currently a CNRS research associate at the Institute of Evolutionary Science of Montpellier (ISEM, France).

Welcome, Jos, and thank you for participating!
