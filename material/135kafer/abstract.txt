As many biologists, I'm interested in the diversity of species, and
the differences in diversity that exist between clades, and I'm thus excited by
all the methods that now exist to quantify diversification rates. Indeed, some
traits have been proposed to be "key innovations", conferring evolutionary
advantages to the lineages in which they evolved. In plants, such traits might
be flowers, self-incompatibility, or specialized insect pollination. Although
considerable progress has been made in the modelling of diversification rates,
the current models remain extremely simple compared to the complex dynamics of
diversification in the real world. First, diversification has been shown to be
influenced by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Second, traits do not act in
isolation but are always embedded in the physiological, morphological and
ecological context of the species. These are seemingly trivial observations but
they have largely failed to be taken into account in diversification research,
and I'll explore some of their implications.
