Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is single-cell analysis, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Reza Kalhor.

Reza did his PhD with Lin Chen and Frank Alber at the University of Southern California, working on the 3D organization of the genome; he did his postdoctoral training with George Church at Harvard Medical School working on technologies to store digital and biological information in DNA.
Broadly speaking, Reza is interested in using molecular recording and genomic barcoding technologies to better understand dynamical biological systems such as embryos.
Reza is currently an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Welcome, Reza, and thank you for participating!
