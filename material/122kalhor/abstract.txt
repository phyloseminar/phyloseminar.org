Natural and induced somatic mutations that accumulate in the genome during development record the phylogenetic relationships of cells; whether these lineage barcodes capture the dynamics of complex progenitor fields remains unclear. We introduce quantitative fate mapping (QFM), an approach to map the fate and dynamics of intermediate progenitor populations during development from their descendantsâ€™ lineage barcodes. QFM involves two stages. First, we infer a time-scaled phylogenetic tree from single-cell lineage barcodes using Phylotime, a scalable maximum likelihood clustering approach with a generalizable barcoding mutagenesis model. Second, we reconstruct the hierarchy, commitment times, population sizes, and commitment biases of progenitor states using the ICE-FASE algorithm which uses nodes in the time-scaled phylogeny that are associated with fate decisions as chronometers of progenitor population dynamics. We validate these approaches using realistic in silico and in vitro barcoding experiments. We further establish criteria for the number of cells that must be analyzed for robust quantitative fate mapping and a progenitor state coverage statistic to assess the robustness. This work demonstrates how lineage barcodes, natural or synthetic, enable analyzing progenitor fate and dynamics long after embryonic development in any organism.
