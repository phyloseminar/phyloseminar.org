Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the first talk in a series of three talks on synteny and its connections with phylogenetics.

Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Nadia El-Mabrouk.

Nadia did her Ph.D. with Maxime Crochemore at Université Marne-La-Vallée in France, before joining the Mathematical Research Center (Centre de Recherche Mathématiques, CRM) at the University of Montreal for a postdoc with David Sankoff in 1998. She is presently full professor, and graduate studies director at the Computer Science Department (Département d’informatique et de recherche opérationnelle, DIRO) at the University of Montreal. 

She has longstanding experience in developing algorithms for comparative genomics and more specifically genome rearrangements, gene tree reconstruction and tree reconciliation. Nadia is involved, each year, in the program committee of some of the most popular conferences in computational biology such as ISMB/ECCB, RECOMB, WABI and others. She is regularly involved in the organization of bioinformatics workshops, the latest being the “Novel Mathematical Paradigm for Phylogenomics” workshop held last summer at the Banff International Research Station.

Welcome, Nadia, and thank you for participating!
