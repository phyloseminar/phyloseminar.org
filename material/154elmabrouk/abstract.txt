Several biological systems rely on sets of colocalized genes sharing a common evolutionary history, and recovering such history is an important step towards elucidating many biological questions. This has been the focus of our group in the last years. We developed Synesth (for SYNteny Evolution in SegmenTal Histories) predicting the evolution of homologous genomic regions, also called syntenies, through segmental events such as duplications, horizontal transfers, gains or losses, likely involving multiple genes. The algorithm is based on a reconciliation framework comparing two topologies: a species tree and a synteny tree. Through an algebraic dynamic programming scheme, Synesth can produce various kinds of outputs (number of events, minimum cost, Pareto-optimal vectors, a single history, a set of equivalent histories, etc). However, as phylogenetic studies usually lead to gene trees, the main challenge of using Synesth is to have an appropriate synteny tree as input. Therefore, we also developed FullSynesth rather taking as input a set of gene trees and simultaneously building and reconciling a synteny supertree. Moreover, to make the problem tractable, gains were excluded from the optimization function, i.e. contrary to losses, taking advantage of simultaneous gains of multiple was disregarded. Therefore, we then studied the problem of minimizing gain and loss episodes on a tree, starting with a simple and tractable version of the Small Parsimony Problem.

This presentation will provide an overview of the problem, its various algorithmic aspects, computational complexity, and those related to the solution space, and we will give some examples of biological applications.
