Over the past two respiratory seasons, we’ve successfully sequenced over 3,000 human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) genomes at the Minnesota Department of Health – Infectious Disease Laboratory. These efforts began as a foil to our SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts, but have grown into a pioneer project for tracking the evolution of this widespread pathogen. In this seminar, Henry will discuss the development of this surveillance program, the application of phylogenetics to identify and track the emergence and seasonal changes in hRSV clades, the applications for genomic epidemiology, and how the efforts of one state lab can have widespread impact on the global picture of the virus. He will also touch on some ongoing work exploring efforts to identify sites that are shaped by positive natural selection and how some may play a role in vaccine and drug resistance. Finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion about some of the challenges and goals for refining these methods and expanding hRSV surveillance nationally and globally.
