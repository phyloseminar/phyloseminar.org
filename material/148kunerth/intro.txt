Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the first talk in a series of 3 talks on the intersection of phylogenetics and public health.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Henry Kunerth.

Henry completed his PhD in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Cornell University in 2022. There he studied the evolutionary genomics, population genetics, and speciation of an invasive moth, the European Corn Borer. After that he made a jump into the world of public health, joining the Minnesota Department of Health â€“ Infectious Disease Laboratory as a research scientist and bioinformatician. 

Broadly, he has interests in applying insights from his PhD studies to better understand infectious disease outbreaks and how the genomes of the pathogens that drive these outbreaks might be shaped by natural selection. 

He also has strong interests in teaching, which he currently applies by disseminating methods and best practices learned in public health to help educate a new generation of laboratorians, bioinformaticians, and genomic epidemiologists across the globe. 

Welcome, Hentry, and thank you for participating!
