Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is the fossilized birth-death process, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.

Rachel did her PhD at the university of Bristol with Philip Donoghue, then post docs at the Smithsonian with Peter Wagner and ETH Zurich with Tanja Stadler. Since last year she has been a professor in the geology department at FAU, working on phylogenetics and quantitative paleobiology.
