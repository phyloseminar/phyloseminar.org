Inference of a species network from genomic data by standard approaches is computationally prohibitive, except for quite small data sets. The NANUQ algorithm provides a more scalable approach, yet still provides a statistically consistent estimate of most network features under the Network Multispecies Coalescent Model. Taking previously inferred gene trees as input, it performs rapid statistical testing at the quartet level. Test results are used to define a novel inter-taxon distance, to which the Neighbor-Net Algorithm is then applied to construct a splits graph. While the splits graph is not the same as the unknown network, certain interpretation rules allow species network structure to be read from it, and violations of the level-1 assumption to be judged. This talk will explain the algorithm more fully, and illustrate its use through the MSCquartets R package.
