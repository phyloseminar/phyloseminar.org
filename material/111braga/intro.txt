Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is evolutionary ecology, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Mariana Braga, a Brazilian biologists who moved to Sweden to do a PhD in Ecology. She is interested in understanding how ecological interactions evolve, using butterflies and their host plants as a model system. Since completing her PhD she did a postdoc in the US to dive more into development of inference methods and now I am back in Sweden (+ Finland) working on a new project aiming at combining evolution of species interactions with projections of species distribution.

Welcome, Mariana, and thank you for participating!
I am especially grateful to Mariana for helping co-organize this session of 3 talks.
