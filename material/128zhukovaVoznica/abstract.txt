Phylodynamics uses pathogen genomes as a source of information for epidemiological parameter  inference. With constantly growing genome sequence availability, it has a high potential as an alternative source on epidemics dynamics, conserving information on transmission between individual patients, clusters and infected subpopulations. However due to the high complexity of differential equations used in phylodynamic models, current implementations might suffer from numerical instability and are typically applicable to datasets of limited size (<500 sequences).

In this talk we will discuss ways towards breaking this computational bottleneck for Multi-Type Birth-Death Models (MTBD). First, we will discuss mathematical properties of these models that make their differential equation resolution highly parallelizable. We will illustrate it with the example of our new Birth-Death Exposed-Infectious (BDEI) model implementation in the Maximum Likelihood framework. This model targets pathogens featuring an incubation period, such as Ebola and SARS-CoV2. Secondly, we will introduce a deep learning approach, PhyloDeep, which is simulation-based and therefore likelihood-free. We will compare its parameter inference performance to the aforementioned BDEI estimator and to the gold-standard Bayesian tool BEAST2 (for three common MTBD models, including BDEI).   
Our new estimators are fast, accurate and applicable to very large datasets (10 000 samples). On top of that, the deep learning approach opens opportunities for parameter estimation of a large spectrum of new models, including those for which the likelihood function is hard to define.
