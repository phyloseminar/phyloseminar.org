Phylodynamic inference allows us to extract information on determinants of epidemic dynamics from sampled pathogen genomes. Specifically, phylodynamics seeks to infer the structure and parameterization of dynamic population models from patterns of shared ancestry. A key problem in phylodynamics has been a mismatch between inference methodology and epidemiological models: the approximations that must be made to perform inference conflict with questions of great interest. I will describe recent work in which we have obtained exact expressions for phylodynamic likelihoods associated with population models of (almost) arbitrary complexity. These results unify and strictly extend existing approaches and broaden the scope of phylodynamic inference methods.

In the second talk, I will deduce an exact expression for the likelihood of an observed genealogy, as the solution to a well-defined filter equation, which can be solved numerically using standard Monte Carlo techniques. I will conclude by highlighting the need for improved algorithms and indicating some open questions.
