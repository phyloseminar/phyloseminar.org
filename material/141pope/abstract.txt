The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) encodes the complete genealogical relationships among a set of recombinant DNA sequences; and is therefore a (very high-dimensional) sufficient statistic for many evolutionary and population genetic models. Over the past decade, numerous methods have been developed to infer an ARG (or partial ARG) from phased variants, often using heuristics for the sake of scalability. There are two major obstacles to the use of these 'empirical' ARGs for subsequent model-based inference (for example, to fit and evaluate complex demographic models). First, error in ARG reconstruction is inevitable and difficult to characterize; second, the likelihood of a parameterized model given an ARG is challenging to compute even in the absence of error. I describe a statistical framework which mitigates these issues by viewing ARGs as collections of dated events (e.g. coalescences) from which simpler time-to-event distributions can be readily approximated. Heavily parameterized models may be fit by matching empirical and expected hazard functions of marginal time-to-event distributions, using standard methods from the theory of continuous-time Markov processes. More generally, this approach projects an ARG to a set of time-indexed summary statistics that are highly informative while remaining robust to reconstruction error.
