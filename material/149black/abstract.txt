In this seminar I'll describe the bread and butter applications of genomic epidemiology in public health practice, contrast genomic epidemiological research projects with the realities of applied genomic epidemiology in practice, and highlight the unique opportunities and particular challenges one encounters in public health. To make this more concrete, I'll show examples from our recent work using genomics to support H5N1 outbreak response in Washington. I'll close with some of the opportunities I see for academic research to strengthen applied genomic epidemiology in public health practice.
