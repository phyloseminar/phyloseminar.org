In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic trees and networks are widely used to unravel the ancestral history of entities such as species, viruses, and cancer cells. In the context of species evolution, phylogenetic trees are limited  to the representation of speciation events whereas phylogenetic networks additionally allow for the representation of non tree-like processes, such as hybridization and lateral gene transfer. However, reconstructing phylogenetic networks is substantially more challenging than reconstructing phylogenetic trees. It is therefore natural to investigate the reconstruction of phylogenetic networks from smaller building blocks. In the context of phylogenetic trees, a well-known result states that every rooted phylogenetic tree is reconstructible from its set of induced subtrees on three leaves. In this talk, we make a first step towards generalising this result to phylogenetic networks and show that each normal (phylogenetic) network can be reconstructed from its set of induced caterpillar trees on three and four leaves.
