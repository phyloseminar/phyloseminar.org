Protein coevolution and phylogeny are useful properties of genes, and there exist well known algorithms to infer both. However, phylogeny influences coevolution inference and vice versa. I propose a method of inferring both at the same time to make both inferences more accurate. In order to do so, I have created a differentiable tree structure that uses a hyperbolic space embedding to smoothly infer joint phylogeny and coevolution information. In this presentation, I will describe the structure and evaluate its efficacy.
