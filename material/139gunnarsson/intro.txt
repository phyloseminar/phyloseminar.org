Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the second time we've had a series on ancestral recombination graphs and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Arni Gunnarsson.

Árni did his PhD with Pier Palamara at the University of Oxford. His research interests include genealogical inference and applications of genome-wide genealogies to problems in statistical genetics. He is currently a research scientist at deCODE genetics in Reykjavík, Iceland.

Welcome, Arni, and thank you for participating!
