Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is birth-death idenitifiability again, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Jonathan Terhorst. Jonathan is an assistant professor in the statistics department at the University of Michigan. He received his PhD from UC Berkeley in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Yun Song. His lab develops probabilistic models and statistical methods for studying evolution, with specific applications to demographic inference, detecting natural selection, and, recently, genetic epidemiology and phylodynamics. Dr. Terhorst and his group strive to develop scalable new inference methods, backed by high quality software implementations that can be used by other scientists, and also to understand these methods theoretically where possible.

Welcome, Jonathan, and thank you for participating!
