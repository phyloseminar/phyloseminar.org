The phylogenetic birth-death process is a probabilistic model of evolution that is widely used to analyze genetic data. In a striking result, Louca & Pennell (Nature, 2020) recently showed that this model is statistically unidentifiable, meaning that an arbitrary number of different evolutionary hypotheses are consistent with any given data set. This grave finding has called into question the conclusions of a large number of evolutionary studies which relied on this model.

In this talk, I will give an introduction to the phylogenetic birth-death process, and explain Louca and Pennell's unidentifiability result. Then, I will describe recent positive results that we have obtained, which establish that, by restricting the evolutionary hypothesis space in certain biologically plausible ways, statistical identifiability is restored. Finally, I will discuss some complementary hardness-of-estimation results which show that, even in identifiable model classes, obtaining reliable inferences from finite amounts of data may be extremely challenging. This is joint work with Brandon Legried.
