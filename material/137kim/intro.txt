Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is microbial genetics, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Eunsoo Kim.

Eunsoo did her PhD at the Department of Botany at University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Linda Graham and Tom Sharkey, then worked in John Archibald lab at Dalhousie University (Canada) as postdoctoral researcher between 2007 and 2012. The then moved to New York City for a tenure track faculty position at the American Museum of Natural History. Eunsoo was tenure promoted at the AMNH in 2017 and worked there til 2022 when she moved back to her home country for her current faculty position in the Division of EcoScience at Ewha Womans University, South Korea.

Eunsoo's research career centers around the evolution and ecology of protists; she was drawn to the mystery surrounding the symbiotic origin of eukaryotic photosynthesis as she started out her PhD training and many of her published work reflects this. Also she enjoys exploring the new protistan diversity using both culturing and sequencing tools.

Welcome, Enusoo, and thank you for participating!
