Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the last talk in a series of 3 talks on next-generation sequence evolution models.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Antoine started as a biochemist and structural biologist. He received his B.S. in Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology from UCLA, and then went on to do his Ph.D. in Structural Biology with Brian Kobilka at Stanford University. There, he worked to understand the molecular basis of G protein-coupled receptor activation and signaling using structural and biochemical methods. This experience kicked off an interest in learning about expansion of function in protein families that share a common fold. He is currently a postdoc at UC Berkeley, having made the transition to computational biology and machine learning, advised by Yun S. Song and David Savage. 

Welcome, Antoine, and thank you for participating!
