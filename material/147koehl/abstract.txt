Models of protein evolution seek to quantify how proteins evolve over time while experiencing intricate constraints and adapting new functions. These models are the engine of phylogenetics, enabling, amongst other applications, phylogenetic tree reconstruction and ancestral sequence inference. Classic and contemporary work in protein sequence modeling incompletely address each othersâ€™ shortcomings - the gold standard classical models (e.g. WAG, LG) are limited by a need to consider sites in protein sequences as evolving independently, and while deep protein language models are able to account for interactions between sites, they lack an explicit time component. Here, we tackle this challenge by introducing a framework for training deep evolutionary models on protein family trees. By constructing comprehensive training datasets, we are able to train a deep generative model that bridges this methodological gap to model evolutionary transitions on unaligned sequence pairs, capturing the full spectrum of evolutionary forces including insertions and deletions. Our model, termed PEINT (Protein Evolution IN Time) significantly outperforms classical evolutionary approaches and enables realistic simulations of evolutionary trajectories. This advance opens new possibilities to understand and harness evolution for protein design, variant effect prediction, viral evolution forecasting, and statistical phylogenetics.
