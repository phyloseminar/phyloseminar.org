Phylogenetic placement, the addition of a query sequence onto an existing backbone phylogeny, has been studied extensively using methods such as maximum likelihood. In this talk, we explore the distance-based approach to phylogenetic placement with two goals: (1) formulating placement as a least-squares problem that can be solved efficiently (in linear time), and (2) exploring both traditional and new exciting directions for computing distances. We show that the distance-based framework is versatile. For example, it enables placement with or without alignments, a feature that enables applications of placement to unassembled data. We also discuss how instead of using traditional Markov models of sequence evolution, we can use machine learning to train neural network models directly from the data in a way that enables distance calculation. When the sequence data have not evolved on the backbone tree under traditional models, the machine learning method has the potential to increase the accuracy of distances. In particular, we show that the deep learning approach paired with distance-based placement, implemented in a method called DEPP, enables insertion onto a species tree using data from one or a handful of genes rather than genome-wide data. We end by showing how DEPP can be used to combine 16S and metagenomic data by inserting them into a single tree.
