Phylodynamic inference allows us to extract information on determinants of epidemic dynamics from sampled pathogen genomes. Specifically, phylodynamics seeks to infer the structure and parameterization of dynamic population models from patterns of shared ancestry. A key problem in phylodynamics has been a mismatch between inference methodology and epidemiological models: the approximations that must be made to perform inference conflict with questions of great interest. I will describe recent work in which we have obtained exact expressions for phylodynamic likelihoods associated with population models of (almost) arbitrary complexity. These results unify and strictly extend existing approaches and broaden the scope of phylodynamic inference methods.

In the first talk, I will discuss what phylodynamics is, describe commonly used approaches to phylodynamic inference, and explain the need for better methods. I will then show how so-called Markov genealogy processes provide a useful formalism for the problem. In particular, I will show how every discretely structured Markov population process induces a unique Markov process in the space of genealogies.
