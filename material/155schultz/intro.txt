Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the second talk in a series on synteny.

Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Darrin Schultz.

Darrin did his PhD at University of California, Santa Cruz with Richard Green, and with Steven Haddock at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. There, he combined marine biology, evolution, and comparative genomics to study early animal evolution, how genomes changed during animal diversification, and how bioluminescent lineages gained the ability to glow. He then joined University of Vienna as a postdoctoral scholar in Oleg Simakov's lab, where he worked to uncover rules of chromosome-scale evolution across animal biodiversity.

He is now a postdoctoral scholar in Longzhi Tan's lab in the Department of Neurobiology at Stanford University, using single-cell approaches to understand aging and neurodegeneration in humans and mice. He will start as an assistant professor of genomics at Lehigh University in July 2026.

Broadly speaking, Darrin's interests center on how animals evolved and diversified, and how chromosome architecture both shapes and is shaped by that diversification. He has received several honors, including a Fulbright Fellowship, the NSF GRFP, and a Young Investigator award from the University of Vienna.

Welcome, Darrin, and thank you for participating!
