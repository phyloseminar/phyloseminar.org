Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is the fossilized birth-death process, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. April Wright.
April did her PhD at UT Austin with David Hillis. Following this, her postdoctoral time was split between the Holder lab at University of Kansas, the Heath Lab at Iowa State University and the Moreau lab at the Field Museum. She currently runs a mostly-undergraduate lab at Southeastern Louisiana University.

Welcome, April, and thank you for participating!
