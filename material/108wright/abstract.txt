The fossilized birth-death (FBD) process provides a model for inference of phylogeny, divergence times, and other macroevolutionary parameters. The model is typically used as one component in a hierarchical Bayesian model. The other two components are the mode of character (molecular, morphological, or protein) evolution and the clock model. Since its original publication, extensions to the FBD to incorporate additional information, such as biogeographic range and species occurrence counts, have been published. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the fossilized birth-death model. Despite the mathematical extensibility and elegance of the model, it can be difficult for researchers to know how to choose reasonable priors for model parameters. I will also discuss my work using common paleobiological tools to establish reasonable priors on parameters such as speciation, extinction, and fossil sampling. Finally, I will present some practical considerations for model evaluation and exploration of results.
