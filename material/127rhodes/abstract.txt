Models of tree generation, building on Yule's classical framework (1925), have played a role in many different sorts of biological studies. However, our understanding of whether the use of the more complex model variants for parameter estimation could be justified has only recently progressed. Although Louca & Pennell's non-identifiablity results (2020) for models with time-dependent speciation and extinction have rightfully received much attention, they do not apply to a different class of  tree generation models which allow changes in rates across lineages in the developing tree. Perhaps the best know example of this class is the Binary-State Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE) model of Maddison et al. (2007), in which a changing binary trait determines speciation and extinction dynamics. Extensions to non-binary discrete traits, quantitative traits, and a more complex model with a hidden process determining trait influence, have also been developed and applied. Recently D. Dragomir, E. Allman and I established the first identifiability result among this class of models, for the "pure-birth multitype" model.

In this talk, after explaining the class of models and their uses, I will outline the key ideas in the analysis establishing identifiability. Although the current result applies only to models with no extinction, I will also speculate on prospects for extending it, as well as on possible issues with applications in data analysis.
