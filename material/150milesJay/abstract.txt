With the rapid growth of pathogen genomics in public health comes the increasing potential for applying phylogenetic methods within the applied public health space. While there is an immense availability of data, the infrastructure, systems, and workforce within public health are largely not designed to maximize that potential. In this seminar, Arianna will discuss some of the ways phylogenetic methods have been applied within public health to date. She will also share some of the unique challenges, opportunities, and hopes for the future for translating findings from phylogenetic approaches to public health action.
