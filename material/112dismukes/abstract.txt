Cophylogenetic methods assess the discordance between host phylogeny and a symbiont phylogeny; however, few of these methods make use of generative models. Most of these methods rely on pattern-based statistics (also called global fit methods) or fitting of the symbiont tree onto the host tree using parsimony. Recent work has introduced a simple generative model, the cophylogenetic birth-death model, for simulating interacting host and symbiont phylogenies in tandem. Here I use the cophylogenetic birth-death model to train a deep learning method using summary statistics for the host and symbiont phylogeny to estimate parameters of the cophylogenetic birth-death model. These preliminary results explore the potential of machine learning in cophylogenetics and in related problems such as biogeography.
