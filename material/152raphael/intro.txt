Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the first talk in a series of 3 talks on the intersection of phylogenetics and cancer research.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Ben Raphael.

Dr. Raphael is Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. His research is focused on the design and application of computational methods to analyze large-scale biological data. His group uses diverse computational approaches including combinatorial optimization, graph algorithms, machine learning, and statistical methods. Recent areas of emphasis include cancer evolution, network/pathway analysis of genetic variants, and structural variation in human and cancer genomes. His algorithms have been used in multiple projects from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC).

Welcome, Ben, and thank you for participating!
