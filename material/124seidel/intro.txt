Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is single-cell analysis, and this the third talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Sophie Siedel.

Sophie did her undergraduate studies in Molecular Medicine at the University of Tübingen, where she worked on the proteinogenic potential of non-coding regions with Andrei Lupas.
She then completed a Master’s degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at ETH Zurich, focusing on systems biology and phylogenetics.
Sophie is currently pursuing her PhD with Tanja Stadler at ETH Zurich, where she develops phylogenetic methods for developmental biology applications.
Sophie is broadly interested in techniques to trace cell lineages and to model the resulting data to learn more about the development of organisms and tissues.

Welcome, Sophie, and thank you for participating!
