Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the first talk in a series of 3 talks on the intersection of phylogenetics and cancer research.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Niko Beerenwinkel.

Dr. Beerenwinkel is Full Professor of Computational Biology at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering of ETH Zurich in Basel. His research is at the interface of mathematics, statistics, and computer science with biology and medicine. It includes statistical, evolutionary, and network modeling of molecular profiling data. He has developed several computational methods for supporting molecular diagnostics in oncology and virology, including for the analysis of tumor single-cell genomics data and of deep sequencing data obtained from virus populations.

Welcome, Niko, and thank you for participating!
