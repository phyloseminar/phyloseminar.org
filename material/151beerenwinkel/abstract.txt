Cancer progression is a somatic evolutionary process characterized by the accumulation of genetic alterations and responsible for tumor growth, clinical progression, and drug resistance development. I will present probabilistic models for reconstructing the evolutionary history of a tumor from single-cell sequencing data, including efficient inference algorithms for mutation calling and for learning tumor phylogenies from mutation and copy number data. I will also discuss computational methods for finding common patterns of tumor evolution among patients and for inferring the underlying cellular fitness landscape of cancer evolution.
