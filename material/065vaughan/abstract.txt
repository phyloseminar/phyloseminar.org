Homologous recombination is a central feature of bacterial evolution,
yet confounds traditional phylogenetic methods.  In this seminar I
will present a novel approach to inferring bacterial evolution based
on the ClonalOrigin model (Didelot et al., Genetics, 2010). This
method permits joint Bayesian inference of the entire bacterial
recombination graph and associated model parameters. The method is
implemented in the BEAST 2 phylogenetic inference package. It can be
easily combined with a variety of substitution models accounting for
site-to-site clock rate heterogeneity as well as parametric and
non-parametric models of effective population size dynamics.  I will
also present work on summarizing posterior distributions over the
space of tree-based recombination graphs which, together with the
joint inference method, aims to bridge the technological gap between
recombination-aware phylogenetic inference and traditional methods.
