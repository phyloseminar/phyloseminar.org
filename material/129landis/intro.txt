Michael received his PhD in Integrative Biology from UC Berkeley, studying with John Huelsenbeck. Then he did a brief postdoc with Tracy Heath at Iowa State University, followed by another postdoc with Michael Donoghue at Yale University. He is generally interested in phylogenetics and, in particular, models and methods for investigating the evolution, ecology, and biogeography of species. Michael is currently an assistant professor in Biology and Computer Science & Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis.

Welcome, Michael, and thank you for participating!
