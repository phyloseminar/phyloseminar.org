Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
This is the second talk in a series of 3 talks on next-generation sequence evolution models.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Faruck Morcos.

Dr. Morcos is an Associate Professor in Biological Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas, with affiliate appointments in Bioengineering and Physics. He directs the Evolutionary Information Lab, focusing on the intersection of biology, computation, information theory, and biological physics.

His research develops methods to extract biological information from sequence and genomic data, creating models for molecular evolution, protein structure, function, and design. Recent work includes machine learning approaches to study protein sequence space and unified evolutionary models. His lab predicts mutation effects in protein families to design chimeric repressors, biosensors, and discover variants that could restore function in disease-related proteins.

Dr. Morcos completed postdoctoral training at UCSD and Rice University, earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Notre Dame, and holds an MS in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich.

Welcome, Dr. Morcos, and thank you for participating!
