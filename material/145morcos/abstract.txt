The use of coevolutionary information, i.e. the knowledge of amino acid or nucleotide interactions maintained through evolution in each protein family, has provided a framework to study structural biology in a predictive manner. Amino acid couplings, obtained from inference algorithms like Direct Coupling Analysis, have been fundamental to predict non-local interactions in protein three-dimensional structure, being now the core of state-of-the-art protein structure prediction algorithms. Coevolutionary information has had an impact in understanding conformational plasticity, complex prediction in molecular interactions and specificity in signal transduction and predicting the effect of mutations. In this seminar I will discuss new directions in the study of global models of sequence evolution, primarily focused on the integration of theory and experiment. I will present recent advances in my lab integrating the statistical mechanics of sequences to develop a model of sequence evolution called Sequence Evolution with Epistatic Contributions (SEEC) that unifies several statistical features of independent models by integrating epistatic contributions and context dependance in the formulation of evolutionary landscapes. We then demonstrate how this model can produce, in silico, evolved sequences that are functional, in vivo, even after a large number of mutational events proposed by the dynamics of the model.
