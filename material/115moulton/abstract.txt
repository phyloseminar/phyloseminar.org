A phylogenetic network is a graph-theoretical tool that is used by biologists to represent the evolutionary history of a collection of species. One of the key questions in phylogenetic combinatorics is to pin down whether a phylogenetic network can be reconstructed or not from different sorts of data that can be associated to network (e.g. the matrix of distances between any pair of leaves in the network, or the set of subnetworks induced on any triple of leaves). Answers to this question are useful as they can lead to algorithms for constructing phylogenetic networks from biological data which are guaranteed to work correctly for 'perfect' data. In this talk, we shall briefly review some relevant theory from phylogenetic combinatorics before presenting some recent results on reconstructability of phylogenetic networks.
