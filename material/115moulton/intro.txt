Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is building phylogenetic networks, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Vincent Moulton, who is Professor in Computational Biology at University of East Anglia. After completing his PhD at Duke University, he has worked as a researcher at University of Bielefeld, University of Canterbury, Massey University, Mid Sweden University, Uppsala University and now University of East Anglia.
His research interests include phylogenetics, computational biology of RNA, short RNAs, metagenomics, algorithms in bioinformatics, and discrete structures such as graphs and finite metric spaces.

Welcome, Vincent, and thank you for participating!
