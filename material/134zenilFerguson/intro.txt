Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is state-dependent speciation and extinction models, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Rosana Zenil-Ferguson.

Dr. Zenil-Ferguson did her PhD at the University of Florida with Jos√© Miguel Ponciano and Gordon Burleigh. Followed by two postdoctoral positions with Luke Harmon ( University of Idaho), and Emma Goldberg (University of Minnesota- currently Los Alamos National Laboratory). 

Her lab focuses on the development of new mathematical models and statistical tools to solve key questions of plant macroevolution. The main goal of the lab is to understand how plant traits evolve and how those traits link to the diversification patterns observed in the tree of life.

Dr. Zenil-Ferguson is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at the University of Kentucky.

Welcome, Rosana, and thank you for participating!
