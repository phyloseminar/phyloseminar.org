Sixteen years have passed since Wayne Maddison, Peter Midford, and Sally Otto introduced the binary state speciation and extinction model (BiSSE). BiSSE revolutionized the field of phylogenetic comparative analysis by enabling us to investigate the influence of traits on the tempo of speciation and extinction. However, working with phylogenies presents challenges. The lack of independence between taxa complicates likelihood calculations, and as phylogenies grow, additional factors such as accelerated extinction and unmeasured variables can impact diversification rates.

In this presentation, I will explore recent advancements in state-dependent diversification models using the graphical modeling software RevBayes. I will demonstrate how to incorporate multiple traits and assess their respective contributions to the diversification process. Additionally, I will show how to integrate enhanced extinction histories and conclude by explaining how to measure the significance of diversification based on transition type and not state value within a cladogenetic framework.
