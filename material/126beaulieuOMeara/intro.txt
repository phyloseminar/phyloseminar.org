Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is birth-death idenitifiability again, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Jeremy did his PhD with Michael Donoghue at Yale University. His main research interests developing new phylogenetic comparative methods to gain insights into the biogeography, trait evolution, and diversification patterns in flowering plants. Jeremy is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
Brian Oâ€™Meara did his PhD with Michael Sanderson, Phil Ward, and Michael Turelli at UC Davis. He develops and uses comparative methods to understand trait evolution, diversification, phylogeography, and more. He is a professor at the U. of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Welcome, both, and thank you for participating!
