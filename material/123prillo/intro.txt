Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is single-cell analysis, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.

Today's speaker is Dr. Sebastian Prillo.

Sebastian is a fourth year PhD student in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by Yun Song and Nir Yosef.
Broadly speaking, Sebastian is interested in mathematical and computational biology.
More specifically, Sebastian is interested in statistical phylogenetics and its intersection with single-cell biology.
Recently, Sebastian has been working on branch length estimation for single-cell phylogenies and on rate matrix estimation, with a focus on scalability.

Welcome, Sebastian, and thank you for participating!
