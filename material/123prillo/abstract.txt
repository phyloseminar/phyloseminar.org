CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has enabled lineage tracing for thousands of cells in vivo. However, most of the analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 lineage tracing data have so far been limited to the reconstruction of single-cell topologies, which depict lineage relationships between cells, but not the amount of time that has passed between ancestral cell states and the present. Time-resolved topologies, called chronograms, would allow one to study the evolutionary dynamics of cell populations at an unprecedented level of resolution. Indeed, time-resolved topologies would reveal the exact timing of events on the tree, the relative fitness of subclones, and the dynamics underlying phenotypic changes in the cell population - among other important applications. In this talk, we present a scalable method to refine any given single-cell topology into a single-cell chronogram by estimating its branch lengths. To do this, we leverage a statistical model of CRISPR/Cas9 cutting paired with a novel, conservative version of maximum parsimony. This leads to a convex maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem that can be readily solved with off-the-shelf convex optimization solvers. We show that our conservative version of maximum parsimony avoids the common pitfalls of naive maximum parsimony, while remaining computationally tractable. To stabilize estimates in low information regimes, we propose a simple penalized version of MLE using a minimum branch length and pseudocounts. We benchmark our method using simulations and show that it performs well on several tasks, outperforming more naive baselines. Finally, we apply our method to real data from a lung model of adenocarcinoma to find fitness-associated genes. Our method is available through the cassiopeia open source Python package.
